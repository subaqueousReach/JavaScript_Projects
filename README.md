This repository will contain all works completed as part of my JavaScript Programming course.

## 1. Basic JavaScript Projects
Through these projects and challenges, I've learned to utilize different functions of JavaScript in combination with HTML and CSS code to produce dynamic functions for websites.

### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu that allows the user to "order a pizza" of various sizes with a selection of toppings. It then calculates the total cost of the selections made and displays that total.

### Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe. After the player takes the first turn as X, the computer randomly selects a position to place their O. Turns alternate until 3 in a row is achieved by the player or computer, or if the game ends in a draw, at which point the game resets and the winner takes the first turn of the following round.

### Calculator
This is a calculator web app designed to perform basic math functions and return values.
